Create a simple browser game using **Kaboom.js** where:
- The player is a character that can move left and right with the arrow keys and jump with the spacebar.
- There’s a ground and a few floating platforms to jump on.
- The camera follows the player as they move.
- If the player falls off the screen, the game resets.
- Use rectangles and colors for now (no sprites yet).
- Keep the code clean and beginner-friendly, with comments explaining each section.

Project structure:
- index.html — loads Kaboom.js from CDN and your main.js script.
- main.js — contains all the game logic.

In index.html:
- Create a minimal HTML page that loads Kaboom.js (`https://unpkg.com/kaboom/dist/kaboom.js`) and runs main.js.

In main.js:
- Initialize Kaboom.
- Define gravity.
- Add ground and platforms.
- Add a controllable player.
- Handle jumping and collisions.
- Center the camera on the player.

Make it fully playable in a browser by opening index.html.
